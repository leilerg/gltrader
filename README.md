## GLTrader

*Note: This is currently under development*

This is an interface (with GUI) for automated crypto trading.

It is meant to provide easy access to market data to process and trigger various automatic trading
strategies while providing a visual interface to monitor the kinds of trades that are being
executed. A crpyto-trading framework, where the user only focuses on the strategy, and the I/O is
taken care of.

The community builds the interface, the user privdes the trading logic.


&nbsp;

The GUI is built on the Kivy Framework. It is currently compatible with the Bittrex API.  It uses
[Eric Somdahl's bittrex Python API Wrapper](https://github.com/ericsomdahl/python-bittrex) to run
API calls.
