TO DO


* Exception handling for thread starting in UpdateCandles

* Strategies - Move all strategy decision to the strategy class to which it pertains (volume checks,
  time since monitoring, ...) 

* Strategies - Action to be taken only if enough money available (Balance > min_trade) 

* Strategies - Full configuration in file (wait times, volume multiplications, ...) - Possibly one
  file per strategy   

* Strategies - Every strategy to be initialized with default settings, which are over-ridden by file
  config 

* Strategies - Load config file separately, should make it easier to set have orders called with
  non-hard coded parameters 

* Strategies - Add thread safety and more so there's no need for the candle updates to t.join()
  ... app can continue to run without micro freezes 

* Pump 'n' Dump will get triggered even after 1hr of the actual pump if the monitoring was below
  threshold (could happen that the last 1hr vol is still greater than previous day avg hourly vol) -
  This is not desired behaviour 

* Logging config to be read from file, not hard coded into code

* Clean up - Unused config settings (two settings mainly - "trades_per_tick" and
  "strategy_reset_interval") 

* Momentum strategy

* Actions/order to take rates as input so it can be reused (market buy/limit sell requires a limit
  for the sell... not hardcoded) 

* trader.py: UpdateMarketCandles takes tick interval and time frame as inputs, but that's pointless
  as implemented. Should make it truly dependent.  

* notification.py: Remove the "oneline/header/footer" methods from the various Notification
  sub-classes (Info/Success/Alert/Error) 

* "Pause" button to become "Resume" button after clicking it (On trader notification screen)

* Write a proper "requirements" and/or "instructions" file
